I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

It then took about 10 minutes just to bring us our drinks, despite it not being terribly busy. Our server then left and took 10 more minutes before coming back to take our order and was not very friendly, looking like this was the last place she wanted to be. \\n\\nWe ordered stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer, and placed our entree orders, in fear we would have to wait forever. I ordered the halibut and my wife ordered a shrimp and scallop scampi. Our appetizer was decent, not great. We opted for soup, clam chowder, for our entree side which was actually pretty good. \\n\\nOur dinners then came and things went downhill quickly. My plate included halibut, seafood pasta, and vegetables. The vegetables were clearly frozen and out of a bag. Very disappointing already. The seafood pasta was crab (possibly krab) mixed with rotini noodles. It was OK at best. The halibut was a nice sized portion but did not taste good at all. It tasted old if that even makes sense. My wife's dish was better than mine, but very salty. The scallops were rubbery and not cooked well.\\n\\nAll of this cost us $60 without tip or any drinks from the bar. If the food were delicious I'd be fine with this, but sadly you can get a better meal at red lobster *cringes* or if you were to cook at home. The service was poor which did not help any. For comparison, I went to Four Peaks Brewing today, ordered a stuffed rainbow trout entree for $16 (half what I paid at Seafood Market) and it was leaps and bounds better...from a brew pub!
